       <p>Hi! My name is Kameryn Batingan. I am a Year Up student taking Software Development and Testing at Seattle Central College. In the Year Up program, we are developing skills to prepare for the professional world of internet technology. </p>

       <p>With a focused study on web development, version control, and business communications utilizing and learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as data analysis in excel and version control through Git/GitHub and VS code. </p>

       <p>I have experience in early childhood education, more specifically making art with kids. I’ve always been a creator and have an eye for design. I want to combine creativity, design, and coding. Numerous work experiences with children and customers have taught me time management, teamwork and, problem-solving. I would like to get a job in web development and bring these skills to the company and team I join. </p>

       <p>After gaining a professional brand and experience in web development, I would like to give back to the community by working with non-profits or small businesses, expanding their online presence, and developing their brand. </p>
